Red-leads and dead-leads are to blame for life's outcomes. Living with ""Objection, Rebuttal, Close"".The staff at the Brooklyn office of Premiere Properties is convened by Blake, sent by the bigwigs Murray and Mitch from the downtown head office. Blake's mentality is cutthroat, he implementing a month long contest among the sales staff, with the highest seller by dollar winning a Cadillac Eldorado, the lowest seller who will be fired. Most of the sales staff are incensed as they feel their fate is largely in the hands of the office manager, John Williamson, who hands out the leads - two per day - at his discretion, many of those leads which the salesmen know are useless. In turn, John will only hand out the coveted Glengarry leads to those that sell. What the salesmen without exception also have against John is that he has never been a salesman - John who probably got his job through some sort of nepotism - and has no idea what it takes to be an effective salesman especially in their business. Ricky Roma is the lead salesman thus far this month, which he has been for quite some time, he who seems well on his way to that Cadillac as he already has his next potential target cum client, James Lingk, on the hook. On the other end of the spectrum is aging Shelley Levene, who once long ago was the top seller, but who seems to have lost his touch largely in his desperation. That desperation is ratcheted up a notch with the contest, Shelley who due to personal circumstances can't afford to lose his job. He believes the best way not to lose his job is to gain some sort of favor with John for better leads. George Aaronow and Dave Moss, two other salesmen near the bottom of sales, discuss other possible measures for themselves not to lose the contest, their discussed tactics which are a bit more illegal. Regardless, Dave tries to protect his own butt at George's expense. By the next morning, the fortunes of all those at the Brooklyn office takes a major turn, but not all those changes may be what they appear on the surface.Times are tough in a Chicago real-estate office; the salesmen (Shelley Levene, Ricky Roma, Dave Moss, and George Aaronow) are given a strong incentive by Blake to succeed in a sales contest.

There is no room for losers in this dramatically masculine world; only ""closers"" will get the good sales leads. There is a lot of pressure to succeed, so a robbery is committed which has unforeseen consequences for all the characters.An examination of the machinations behind the scenes at a real estate office.",R

Her sister Margaret becomes friends with his mother, who promises her the family house, Howards End. Unfortunately, after her death, the will disappears and it appears the inheritance will disappear. Until the widower, Henry Wilcox, becomes attracted to Margaret.In Edwardian England, three families - representing three classes - have an impact on one another. The central characters are middle class sisters Margaret and Helen Schlegel. Margaret befriends the seriously ill Ruth Wilcox, matriarch of the Wilcox family who have a country estate known as Howard's End. The younger Helen takes an interest in Leonard Bast, a working class clerk. As Margaret gravitates towards the Wilcoxes, eventually marrying Henry Wilcox after Ruth's death, Helen identifies more and more with Leonard and his wife, particularly after advice they've given him - originally from Henry Wilcox - turns out to be incorrect and for which Leonard pays a heavy price. The clash among them leads to tragedy.In the early twentieth century London, the upper class Schlegel siblings - Margaret, Helen and Tibby - are liberal, straight talking people who indulge themselves in philanthropy and in discussions of the arts and literature. They begin an association with the similarly upper crust Wilcox family. The Wilcoxes - husband and wife Henry and Ruth, and their grown children - are in London temporarily from their Hilton country home, Howards End, which has long been in Ruth's family and where Ruth was born. Most specifically, a friendship develops between Margaret and the sickly Ruth. Their friendship is despite an auspicious past association between the two families, namely a doomed romance between one of the Wilcox's sons, Paul, and Helen, and the fact of the Wilcoxes being more conservative and pretentious in their outlook than the Schlegels. In this regard, the Wilcox children take after their father, the children who believe Margaret has ulterior motives in befriending their mother. In a similar vein, Helen does not much like the Wilcoxes beyond her past association with them. At the same time, the Schlegels also befriend a man named Leonard Bast, a poor clerk, who has what Margaret refers to as a romantic ambition in life, and who has a strong sense of doing the right thing as demonstrated by his marriage to a woman named Jacky, who he does not love but to who he feels protective.

The final showdown takes place in modern times with the Lady being reincarnated as a reporter...In this very alternate take on the Arthurian mythos, in medieval times, great wizard Merlin creates a sword that holds the power of the universe and whoever wields it can decide the fate of the world. Merlin puts his daughter Crystal (also known as Lady of the Lake) in charge of protecting the sword from evil hands until the end of time. Evil Pendragon (played by popular B movie villain Richard Lynch), the son of Mordred, wants the sword for himself in order to destroy time, bring eternal darkness to the world and rule the Earth forever. His opponent is John Pope (played by Peter Phelps of Baywatch fame), a heroic knight who must get to the sword first. Merlin also sends wizard Leong Tao (played by B movie legend James Hong of Big Trouble in Little China fame) to protect Crystal at all cost.

As Halloween nears, she goes to a small old western town to do a research on the powerful local shady mine owner, who unknowingly to her turns out to be Pendragon, who recognizes her. Worried Pope arrives there as well to warn Pendragon that the mine contains toxic fumes and inflammable gases and should not be used any further, so Pendragon recognizes him as well. Crystal and Pope meet there, but do not remember each other or their roles in the big picture, until Leong saves them in the nick of time from Pendragon.

0105200,The Quarrel,"Montreal 1948. On Rosh Hashanah, Chaim (a Yiddish writer) is forced to think of his religion when he's asked to be the tenth in a minyan. As he sits in the park, he suddenly sees an old friend whom he hasn't seen since they quarrelled when they were yeshiva students together. Hersh, a rabbi, survived Auschwitz and his faith was strengthened by his ordeal, while Chaim escaped the Nazis, but had lost his faith long before. The two walk together, reminisce, and argue passionately about themselves, their actions, their lives, their religion, their old quarrel, and their friendship.Rosh Hashana 1948. Chaim Kovler and Hersh Rasseyner were childhood friends in Bialystok, Poland, but have not seen each other in years when they were both twenty. Then, they became estranged for an argument they had on the issue of Judaism, specifically about leaving the yeshiva. Since, Chaim has become a Yiddish writer who has turned his back on the faith. Hersh has become an orthodox rabbi. By chance, they run into each other in a park in Montréal, where Hersh now lives and where New York based Chaim is visiting on a speaking engagement. Each believed the other had perished in the Holocaust. Initially, the two men forgive each other for the quarrel that has estranged them for all these years. But as they spend the better part of the afternoon together walking through the park and talking about their lives, they find that their individual views of Judaism have only strengthened over time, in large part because of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of their respective families, including Chaim's wife. The question becomes whether their chance reunion will reunite them or tear them further apart emotionally.If there is one word to describe this movie it is ""guilt."" The guilt of surviving the holocaust while all others perished, the guilt of leaving family members or friends in limbo expecting the sun always to rise tomorrow, and the guilt of loving a g-d that turned his back on his most ardent followers in their time of need. Chaim and the Rabbi, are two childhood friends haunted by both their past experiences and decisions, or are they? The Rabbi not only feels the guilt of losing his friendship with his best friend Chaim, but when his father apologized for his treatment not accepting that apology. Chaim, while he feels bad about the loss of his friendship with the Rabbi, lives with the guilt of not being there for his family in their time of need. Deep down and side he feels guilty for his actions by hiding his cigarette and helping with the minyan. But in the end, Chaim continues to rejects the lifestyle required of an orthodox Jew and walks off into the sunset. In summary, not only this is a relative debate for those that survived the holocaust resulting in those that grew closer to g-d and those further away but is a movie of unique qualities. It reminded me of the old movies with Humphrey Bogart and other greats with the intense drama between two characters and where no one else existed.",PG-13

0105667,Twist,"Dance in white Middle America up to the early 1950's was traditional ballroom, where dance moves were standardized. It was more a technical exercise than an emotional one. White youth of the period began to look toward the black community and rhythm and blues music, which gave them the sense of wanting just to move in a whole new way. For white Middle American youth, this music morphed into rock and roll. Despite establishment deeming rock and roll to be Satanic and/or Communist, it took off amongst the younger generation. The combination of rock and roll and dance was presented to American youth through Bandstand (1952), which told youth what the trends of the day were. However, much of the dance shown on network television was Caucasians trying to dance like black Americans, but with no hip movement. This changed with the dance ""The Twist"", which also revolutionized the concept of not being reliant on what one's dance partner was doing. Although it had its detractors, The Twist became fashionable across race, generation and socioeconomic status. It became more than a song and a dance - it became a commodity. Because of the craze, everyone was trying to come up with the next big thing, no one ever achieving that goal.The history of post-World War II popular dance up to the mid-sixties is explored with the focus being on the Twist.",PG

0107943,The Remains of the Day,"A rule bound head butler's world of manners and decorum in the household he maintains is tested by the arrival of a housekeeper who falls in love with him in pre-WWII Britain. The possibility of romance and his master's cultivation of ties with the Nazi cause challenge his carefully maintained veneer of servitude.Approximately a quarter century in the lives of James Stevens and Sarah Benn née Kenton - called Sally in the most casual of circumstances - is presented. The bulk of their story takes place in the first few years after their meeting in the 1930s when Mr. Stevens, who has worked this entire period as the butler at Darlington Hall in Oxfordshire, hires Miss Kenton as the new housekeeper for Lord Darlington's stable of servants. The story focuses on their relationship as coworker servants, with Mr. Stevens' position as head of the manor servant staff. An epilogue of sorts is also presented in the 1950s after a twenty year separation and a seven year period of non-correspondence where Mr. Stevens, still at Darlington Hall working as butler for its new owner, retired American Congressman Lewis, goes to visit now separated Mrs. Benn where she now lives in Clevedon in the west country to ask her to return to service at Darlington Hall. Congressman Lewis bought the manor following Lord Darlington's death, his life which eventually was mired in scandal regarding his geopolitical work before, during and after the war. That relationship between Mr. Stevens and Miss Kenton is dictated largely by Mr. Stevens' priority on what he sees as proper decorum in their work, which results in him largely hiding his emotions from everyone, while Miss Kenton, who still does her job as good as any housekeeper, wants Mr. Stevens to come out from that decorum which may make him an even better butler. As feelings start to develop between the two, that wall of decorum that Mr. Stevens has built may prevent anything from happening, especially fraternization between staff has largely been frowned upon by both of them as a disruption to the household.It is the late-1950s and, due to the death of Lord Darlington, Darlington Hall has just been bought by Jack Lewis, an American. On the staff of the hall is the head butler, James Stevens. Through his eyes we see the what took place in the hall over the last 25 or so years, including the lead-up to World War 2, Stevens' undying devotion to his job and master and his relationship with the housekeeper, Miss Kenton.A butler who sacrificed body and soul to service in the years leading up to World War II realizes too late how misguided his loyalty was to his lordly employer.",PG

One of the girls, who is the most talented of the bunch, is forbidden to sing by her mother, although the choir has made it to the state championship. A group of stereotypical incompetent monks tries to stop them.Former Reno lounge singer Deloris Van Cartier, who once took refuge at St. Katherine's convent in San Francisco to evade a contract hit on her, and in the process, as Sister Mary Clarence, was able to rejuvenate the failing parish by transforming what was the sisters' terrible choir into a successful sacred version of her lounge act, parlays the renown from that experience into a popular Las Vegas show. St. Katherine's Mother Superior, who now along with Sisters Mary Lazarus, Mary Patrick and Mary Robert teach at St. Francis Academy still in San Francisco, ask Deloris to return to perform her magic in teaching the academy's music class, Deloris who accepts in her gratitude for what her now friends, the sisters, did to save her life.

Deloris finds that the academy, most specifically the music class, is populated by a bunch of kids who have attitude issues in their belief that they are destined to become nothing as no one, in their mind, cares about them. The student with the biggest attitude issue is Rita Watson, that attitude which masks problems at home with her single mother, hairdresser Florence Watson, who quashes what are Rita's true dreams.

In the process, Deloris discovers that Mr. Crisp, who has a purely economic as opposed to humanistic approach to his job, has recommended that the academy be closed at the end of the school year, and the valuable property sold. If Deloris is able to transform her class into believing in their talents, she, along with what Mary Lazarus, Mary Patrick and Mary Robert discover among the academy's storage, may be part of the school's salvation, that is if they can hide their activities and Mary Clarence's true identity from Crisp.Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) is again asked to don the nun's habit to help a run-down Catholic school, presided over by Mother Superior (Maggie Smith).
