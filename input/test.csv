He is to be used in a prisoner exchange, but the IRA will kill him if need be. Among his captors are Jude, the sexual bait used to lure him, and Fergus, an IRA volunteer who will act as one of his main guards. Through their contact, Jody and Fergus become as close as friends as they can be under the circumstances, and despite both knowing, deep in their hearts, that Jody will most-likely not survive this situation barring an unseen intervention. That friendship is fostered because Jody can sense that Fergus basically has a good heart, from which he cannot run regardless of the situation. Jody's imprisonment does not end quite the way that any of Jody, Fergus or Jude had envisioned. Based on what happens, Fergus decides to go into hiding by moving to London and assuming a new name, Jimmy. But his move to London is primarily to meet Jody's girl, Dil, of who Jody spoke with reverence and care. In the process of being Dil's protector in Jody's absence, Fergus falls for Dil, and visa versa. But Fergus will learn of a fundamental aspect of Dil which may change how he feels for her, and how he interacts with her. In addition, Fergus' IRA past may catch up with him, which may further affect how he wants and decides to interact with Dil. Conversely, Dil may change her mind about ""Jimmy"" if she finds out about ""Fergus"".A British soldier kidnapped by IRA terrorists soon befriends one of his captors, who then becomes drawn into the soldier's world.",
0104040,The Cutting Edge,"At the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary, we see Doug Dorsey battered in a vicious hockey game against West Germany. We then see Kate Moseley doing her program and falling when a lift goes bad. Both have fought all their life to get to the Olympics and suddenly the dream has been shattered. The movie then follows Kate, a tempermental but talented figure skater, through many partners until finally her coach resorts to recruiting a hockey player. Through the difficult training of 15 hours of skating a day they finally prepare for Nationals and the Olympics. A romance is budding and their final show could bend or break them as they try to achieve their dreams of an Olympic Gold medal.Doug Dorsey and Kate Moseley are both part of the American team at the 1988 Winter Olympics, Doug as the star captain of the hockey team, Kate one half of the national champion pairs figure skating team. They both have a disastrous Olympics, Doug suffering a career ending eye injury, and Kate taking a humiliating fall that she blames on her partner, Brian Newman. Fast forward two years, and both are floundering in the pursuit of their dreams. Working class Doug still falsely clings to the hope of an NHL career, whereas no one of any talent wants to skate with Kate, the rich, spoiled diva. Kate's new coach, the renowned Anton Pamchenko, sees that Doug was a good skater and suggests he try out as Kate's partner. Despite or because of the fact that it is hate at first sight, Doug decides to give the partnership a shot, he who may be the only person who has a strong enough personality to hold up to Kate's. Doug's decision is much to Kate's chagrin, she who will do whatever she can to make Doug, who she considers a Neanderthal, quit despite he being her last shot at pairs glory leading up to the 1992 Nationals and 1992 Winter Olympics. Beyond Doug needing to learn the technical aspects of figure skating compared to skating in a hockey game (especially the fact of having skates with toe picks), the two have to overcome differences in personality, differences in artistic vision (such as deciding what it takes to win) and an equally strong temperament to make their partnership a success. They also have to overcome external obstacles, such as narrow minded judges. But the most important thing they each have to learn is what is truly important in their lives.Kate Moseley is talented and spoiled. She and her coach have eliminated her most recent figure skating partner with little time to find a replacement. None of the candidates will do, and her coach finds Doug Dorsey, a college hockey player with no figure skating experience as a last possibility. The two are from totally different worlds and argue constantly, but his strong work ethic brings both her father and her coach around. The two enter international competition trying out a new routine that is dangerous for each of them as their respect for each other finally begins to grow.NHL prospect Doug Dorsey is injured in an Olympic hockey game which leaves him unable to play professionally. Pairs skater Kate Moseley is an ill-tempered figure skater who no one will pair up with after a fall during the same Olympic games. With nowhere else to go, Kate's coach brings in Doug as a potential partner, although Doug has no figure skating experience. Kate is none too thrilled about this arrangement and tries to antagonize Doug into leaving, but his strong work ethic and lack of options convinces him to stay in it, to the point that he begins to like figure skating! The pair undergo grueling, rigorous training to finalize a program for U.S. National championships - and from there, the Olympics and a possible gold medal.A temperamental figure skater and a former hockey player try to win Olympic gold as a figure skating pairs team.",
