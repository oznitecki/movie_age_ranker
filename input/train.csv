The girl and her younger timid brother secretly wished he was dead. That year, she began a relationship with a Chinaman, who she met on the Mekong River ferry. He was western educated in Paris, came from a wealthy family and as such money was no issue for him, and had never worked a day in his life.

But both began to think that there was the possibility of a future ""them"", driven by their passion and desire.In 1929 French Indochina, a French teenage girl embarks on a reckless and forbidden romance with a wealthy, older Chinese man, each knowing that knowledge of their affair will bring drastic consequences to each other.",R

0101761,The Doors,"Oliver Stone's homage to 1960s rock group The Doors also doubles as a biography of the group's late singer, the ""Electric Poet"" Jim Morrison. The movie follows Morrison from his days as a film student in Los Angeles to his death in Paris, France at age 27 in 1971. The movie features a tour-de-force performance by Val Kilmer, who not only looks like Jim Morrison's long-lost twin brother, but also sounds so much like him that he did much of his own singing. It has been written that even the surviving Doors had trouble distinguishing Kilmer's vocals from Morrison's originals.Meeting each other in UCLA Film School in 1965, Ray Manzarek suggests to Jim Morrison that they form a rock band. With Robby Krieger and John Densmore, that band would become The Doors. Although the foundation of the group was based on consensus, Robby and John in particular increasingly see frontman Jim's on-stage performances self-indulgent - albeit undeniably charismatic - to his controversial lyrics. His on-stage antics are fueled in large part by excessive alcohol and drug use. Outsiders begin seeing Jim as The Doors, while he begins seeing himself as ""The Lizard King"". It is that charisma that gets them a deal with Elektra Records, and resulting fame. Despite his popularity with the record buying public, Jim continually has run-ins with those in authority for his anti-establishment behavior. With him and the band through it all is Jim's longtime girlfriend, Pamela Courson. Theirs is a rocky relationship, primarily over Jim's open infidelity - including with reporter Patricia Kennealy - and drug-induced erratic behavior.The story of the famous and influential 1960s rock band The Doors and its lead singer and composer, Jim Morrison, from his days as a UCLA film student in Los Angeles, to his untimely death in Paris, France at age 27 in 1971.",R

When the parade ends, Paul and his business partner Nigel Griffith, who run Griffith-Wagner Enterprises, step up to a podium and dedicate the Victoria Harbour Tunnel, which is an underwater tunnel that connects Hong Kong Island to the mainland. That night, Paul, Katherine, and the twins are on their way home when Paul notices a carload of Chinese men following them. Paul uses his CB radio to alert his friend Frank Avery to the situation. Paul and Katherine arrive home with the twins a few minutes later, and see that waiting for them is a gang of Chinese men led by a musclebound assassin named Moon.

Chad is approached by a blond haired woman who obviously thinks he's someone else, then a man who looks like Chad knocks Chad out cold. The man is Alex, and the woman is Alex's fiancée Danielle Wilde, who thought Chad was Alex. She, Chad, and Alex are all surprised to be told by Frank that Chad and Alex are brothers. Alex and Danielle have a hard time believing it. Frank explains that Paul supervised the construction of the Victoria Harbour Tunnel. Halfway into the project, Paul encountered financial problems, so he pulled in Nigel Griffith as an equity partner. Nigel got his money from a secret loan, courtesy of Hong Kong drug kingpin Raymond Zhang. When the tunnel was completed, and Paul's expertise was no longer needed, Nigel and Raymond had Paul and Katherine murdered by Moon's hit team.

A few minutes after setting off, Alex's boat is approached by another boat. Alex allows three Chinese men aboard to look over a couple of cars that are on Alex's boat.
